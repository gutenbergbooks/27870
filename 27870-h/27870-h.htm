<span class="i0">And a funnel white with the crusted salt, but never a show of steam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no time to man the brakes, they knocked the shackle free,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And: "Will you fight for it, Reuben Paine, or will you share the pelts?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(Little they trust to sparrow-dust that stop the seal in his sea!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thick smoke hung and would not shift, leaden it lay and blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But three were down on the Baltic's deck and two of the Stralsund's crew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An arm's length out and overside the banked fog held them bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as they heard or groan or word, they fired at the sound.<br /></span>

<h2>THE MARY GLOSTER.</h2>

<span class="i0">Dick, it's your daddy&mdash;dying: you've got to listen to him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good for a fortnight, am I? The doctor told you? He lied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall go under by morning, and&mdash;&mdash; Put that nurse outside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never seen death yet, Dickie? Well, now is your time to learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you'll wish you held my record before it comes to your turn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not counting the Line and the Foundry, the yards and the village, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've made myself and a million; but I'm damned if I made you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Master at two-and-twenty, and married at twenty three&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand men on the pay-roll, and forty freighters at sea!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fifty years between 'em, and every year of it fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I'm Sir Anthony Gloster, dying, a baronite:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I lunched with His Royal 'Ighness&mdash;what was it the papers a-had?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Not least of our merchant-princes." Dickie, that's me, your dad!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I</i> didn't begin with askings. <i>I</i> took my job and I stuck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I took the chances they wouldn't, an' now they're calling it luck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, what boats I've handled&mdash;rotten and leaky and old!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran 'em, or&mdash;opened the bilge-cock, precisely as I was told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grub that 'ud bind you crazy, and crews that 'ud turn you gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The others they duresn't do it; they said they valued their life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(They've served me since as skippers). <i>I</i> went, and I took my wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the world I drove 'em, married at twenty-three,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your mother saving the money and making a man of me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was content to be master, but she said there was better behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took the chances I wouldn't, and I followed your mother blind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She egged me to borrow the money, an' she helped me clear the loan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we bought half shares in a cheap 'un and hoisted a flag of our own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Patching and coaling on credit, and living the Lord knew how,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We started the Red Ox freighters&mdash;we've eight-and-thirty now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those were the days of clippers, and the freights were clipper-freights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we knew we were making our fortune, but she died in Macassar Straits&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we dropped her in fourteen fathom; I pricked it off where she sank.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Owners we were, full owners, and the boat was christened for her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she died out there in childbed. My heart, how young we were!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I went on a spree round Java and well-nigh ran her ashore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But your mother came and warned me and I wouldn't liquor no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strict I stuck to my business, afraid to stop or I'd think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saving the money (she warned me), and letting the other men drink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I met McCullough in London (I'd saved five 'undred then),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'tween us we started the Foundry&mdash;three forges and twenty men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheap repairs for the cheap 'uns. It paid, and the business grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I bought me a steam-lathe patent, and that was a gold mine too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Cheaper to build 'em than buy 'em," <i>I</i> said, but McCullough he shied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Lines were all beginning, and we all of us started fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But McCullough 'e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Brussels and Utrecht velvet, and baths and a Social Hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pipes for closets all over, and cutting the frames too light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But McCullough he died in the Sixties, and&mdash;&mdash; Well, I'm dying to-night....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew&mdash;<i>I</i> knew what was coming, when we bid on the <i>Byfleet's</i> keel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They piddled and piffled with iron: I'd given my orders for steel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steel and the first expansions. It paid, I tell you, it paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run trade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they asked me how I did it, and I gave 'em the Scripture text,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You keep your light so shining a little in front o' the next!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the armour-contracts, but that was McCullough's side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was always best in the Foundry, but better, perhaps, he died.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I went through his private papers; the notes was plainer than print;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'm no fool to finish if a man'll give me a hint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I remember his widow was angry.) So I saw what the drawings meant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I started the six-inch rollers, and it paid me sixty per cent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sixty per cent <i>with</i> failures, and more than twice we could do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a quarter-million to credit, and I saved it all for you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought&mdash;it doesn't matter&mdash;you seemed to favour your ma,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you're nearer forty than thirty, and I know the kind you are.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harrer an' Trinity College! I ought to ha' sent you to sea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I stood you an education, an' what have you done for me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The things I knew was proper you wouldn't thank me to give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you muddled with books and pictures, an' china an' etchin's an' fans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your rooms at college was beastly&mdash;more like a whore's than a man's&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till you married that thin-flanked woman, as white and as stale as a bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she gave you your social nonsense; but where's that kid o' your own?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've seen your carriages blocking the half of the Cromwell Road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never the doctor's brougham to help the missus unload.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(So there isn't even a grandchild, an' the Gloster family's done.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not like your mother, she isn't. <i>She</i> carried her freight each run.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they died, the pore little beggars! At sea she had 'em&mdash;they died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only you, an' you stood it; you haven't stood much beside&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weak, a liar, and idle, and mean as a collier's whelp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nosing for scraps in the galley. No help&mdash;my son was no help!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he gets three 'undred thousand, in trust and the interest paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wouldn't give it you, Dickie&mdash;you see, I made it in trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You're saved from soiling your fingers, and if you have no child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It all comes back to the business. Gad, won't your wife be wild!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls and calls in her carriage, her 'andkerchief up to 'er eye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Daddy! dear daddy's dyin'!" and doing her best to cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grateful? Oh, yes, I'm grateful, but keep 'er away from here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your mother 'ud never ha' stood 'er, and, anyhow, women are queer....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's women will say I've married a second time. Not quite!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But give pore Aggie a hundred, and tell her your lawyers'll fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was the best o' the boiling&mdash;you'll meet her before it ends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm in for a row with the mother&mdash;I'll leave you settle my friends:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a man he must go with a woman, which women don't understand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the sort that say they can see it they aren't the marrying brand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I wanted to speak o' your mother that's Lady Gloster still.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm going to up and see her, without it's hurting the will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here! Take your hand off the bell-pull. Five thousand's waiting for you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you'll only listen a minute, and do as I bid you do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll try to prove me a loony, and, if you bungle, they can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I've only you to trust to! (O God, why ain't he a man?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's some waste money on marbles, the same as McCullough tried&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marbles and mausoleums&mdash;but I call that sinful pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's some ship bodies for burial&mdash;we've carried 'em, soldered and packed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down in their wills they wrote it, and nobody called <i>them</i> cracked.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But me&mdash;I've too much money, and people might.... All my fault:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It come o' hoping for grandsons and buying that Wokin' vault.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm sick o' the 'ole dam' business; I'm going back where I came.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I'm going to lie by your mother, ten thousand mile away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they'll want to send me to Woking; and that's where you'll earn your pay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've thought it out on the quiet, the same as it ought to be done&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quiet, and decent, and proper&mdash;an' here's your orders, my son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know the Line? You don't, though. You write to the Board, and tell<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They'll put her in working order an' you'll take her out as she is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, it was money idle when I patched her and put her aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Thank God, I can pay for my fancies!)&mdash;the boat where your mother died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We dropped her&mdash;I think I told you&mdash;and I pricked it off where she sank.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">After the first stroke warned me I sent him the money to keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the time you'd claim it, committin' your dad to the deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you are the son o' my body, and Mac was my oldest friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've never asked 'im to dinner, but he'll see it out to the end.<br /></span>
